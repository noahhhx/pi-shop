# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick each worker's model with `model: task:<category>` matched to the brief (`task:coding` for implementation slices, `task:recon` for exploration, `task:qa` for verification) or an exact model ID; omitting inherits the parent model. If an exact ID fails to resolve, use the category and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's `thinking` level for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers as N parallel `subagent` calls in one message, each with the step 3 model. Use `agent: "poteto-agent"` unless a workflow names another agent. Pi child processes run locally with isolated context, so give each brief explicit file pointers and prevent concurrent writes to shared paths.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, name the branch in its brief, or spawn it in an isolated worktree with `worktree` based off that branch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
